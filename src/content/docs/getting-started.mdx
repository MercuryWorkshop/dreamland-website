description: A simple guide to jumping right into Dreamland
---

There are a few ways to use Dreamland. You can use it in a plain HTML document, or you can use a build tool like Vite.

## Without a build tool

If you want to use Dreamland right in your HTML with no build step, you can import the Dreamland library in your `<head>`:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dreamland"></script>
```

An example Dreamland app looks like this:

```js
function App() {
  this.counter = 0
  return html`
    <div>
      <button on:click=${() => this.counter++}>Click me!</button>
      <p>${use(this.counter)}</p>
    </div>
  `
}

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  document.body.appendChild(h(App))
})
```

All the functions required to create your Dreamland app will be available globally.

## Creating a custom build

If you want to further control or minimize the bundle size, you might want to consider building Dreamland from source and only enabling the features you want.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/dreamland
cd dreamland
npm install
npm rollup -c --file path/to/output.js --enable-jsxLiterals --disable-css
```

## Using a bundler or build tool

If you want to use JSX (or other NPM modules), you'll want to use a bundler or build tool like Vite, esbuild, rspack, or others.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Install Dreamland with npm:

   ```bash
    npm install dreamland
    ```

2. Configure your build tool:
    
    You can find guides for <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/">Vite</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/">esbuild</a>, and <a href="https://rspack.dev/guide/start/quick-start">rspack</a>.

    If using Vite, adding the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-dreamland">vite-plugin-dreamland</a> plugin to your Vite config will provide you with a better experience.

3. Modify your `tsconfig.json` to configure your editor and build tool to use Dreamland's JSX globals:

   ```json
    {
      // ...
      "jsx":"react",
      "jsxFactory":"h",
      "jsxFragmentFactory":"Fragment",
      "types": ["dreamland"]
    }
    ```
</Steps>

To initialize Dreamland, add this line to the top of your entrypoint file:

```ts
import "dreamland"
```

This will make all Dreamland functions available to you. If using TypeScript, all type definitions will be included as well.
