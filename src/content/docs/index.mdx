		Dreamland has no virtual DOM and an optional build step. You can choose to write your code in pure JavaScript without installing any dependencies.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Extremely versitile" icon="rocket">
		Use Dreamland to power highly reactive applications, or to design complex UI - or both.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Small footprint" icon="open-book">
		Coming in at just 1.6kb (with gzip and minification), it's one of the smallest UI frameworks available, even beating Preact.
